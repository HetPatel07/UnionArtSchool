<h2>Union Art School</h2>
<p>I have developed a full-stack web application called "Union Art School" using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. The application allows students to register, log in, and select the course of their choice. Students can also choose a teacher and opt for private lessons. The application provides an estimated cost for the course and enables students to book the course upon completion of the selection process.</p>
